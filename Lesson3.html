  <section class="lesson">
    <h2>🖥️ Computer System</h2>
    <p>
      A computer system is an integrated set of components that work together to process data and perform tasks. 
      It mainly consists of hardware and software, with various components coordinating to execute instructions.
    </p>

  <!-- Section: Hardware -->
  <section class="lesson">
    <h2>💽 Hardware</h2>
    <p>Hardware refers to the physical parts of a computer that you can see and touch.</p>
    <p><strong>Examples:</strong> keyboard, monitor, hard disk, motherboard, CPU, RAM.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Input devices:</strong> allow users to send data into the computer (e.g., keyboard, mouse).</li>
      <li><strong>Output devices:</strong> display results from the computer (e.g., monitor, printer).</li>
      <li><strong>Storage devices:</strong> store data and programs permanently (e.g., hard drives, SSDs).</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- Section: Software -->
  <section class="lesson">
    <h2>💾 Software</h2>
    <p>Software is the programs and instructions that tell the hardware what to do.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>System software:</strong> manages the computer hardware and provides a platform for applications.
        <br><strong>Example:</strong> Operating System (Windows, macOS, Linux)
      </li>
      <li><strong>Application software:</strong> performs specific tasks for the user.
        <br><strong>Example:</strong> Microsoft Word, web browsers, video games
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- Section: Memory -->
  <section class="lesson">
    <h2>🧠 Memory</h2>
    <p>Memory is where the computer stores data and instructions temporarily or permanently.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Primary memory (RAM):</strong> temporary storage that the CPU uses for active tasks.</li>
      <li><strong>Secondary memory (Hard drives, SSDs):</strong> long-term storage for programs and data.</li>
      <li><strong>Cache memory:</strong> very fast memory inside or near the CPU to speed up processing.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- Section: CPU and Machine Cycle -->
  <section class="lesson">
    <h2>🧩 CPU (Central Processing Unit) & Machine Cycle</h2>
    <p>The CPU is the brain of the computer. It executes instructions and processes data.</p>
    <p>The CPU works in a cycle called the Machine Cycle, which includes four main steps:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Fetch:</strong> retrieves an instruction from memory.</li>
      <li><strong>Decode:</strong> interprets the instruction.</li>
      <li><strong>Execute:</strong> performs the instruction (calculations, data movement).</li>
      <li><strong>Store/Writeback:</strong> saves the result back to memory.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- Section: Control Unit -->
  <section class="lesson">
    <h2>🎛️ Control Unit (CU)</h2>
    <p>The Control Unit is part of the CPU. Its main job is to direct the flow of data between CPU components, memory, and input/output devices.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>It fetches instructions from memory.</li>
      <li>Decodes instructions to tell the CPU what operation to perform.</li>
      <li>Coordinates other units like the ALU, memory, and I/O devices.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- Section: Arithmetic Logic Unit -->
  <section class="lesson">
    <h2>➗ Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)</h2>
    <p>The ALU is another part of the CPU that performs all mathematical and logical operations.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Arithmetic operations:</strong> addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.</li>
      <li><strong>Logical operations:</strong> comparisons like equal to, greater than, less than.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The ALU works closely with the CU, which tells it what operation to perform.</p>
